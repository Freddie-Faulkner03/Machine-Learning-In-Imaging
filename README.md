# Machine Learning in Imaging
## Overview
This project explores the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to imaging-related tasks. Through a series of Jupyter notebooks, it demonstrates how different algorithms—from classical models to modern neural networks—can be used to analyze, classify, and extract meaningful patterns from image data. The notebooks also provide hands-on examples of dimensionality reduction, transfer learning, optimization methods, and sequence modeling.
## Technologies Used
• Python 3 – Primary programming language for all implementations.<br>
• Jupyter Notebook – Environment used to develop and run the experiments.<br>
• Scikit-learn – For classical machine-learning models such as KNN, Random Forest, PCA, and SGD-based methods.<br>
• TensorFlow / Keras – For building and training neural networks including CNNs, LSTMs, MLPs, and for using pre-trained models.<br>
• NumPy & Pandas – For data manipulation, preprocessing, and numerical computations.<br>
• Matplotlib & Seaborn – For visualizing data, model performance, and results.<br>
• NLP Libraries (e.g., NLTK or spaCy, depending on the notebook) – Used in the semantic web–related notebook.<br>
